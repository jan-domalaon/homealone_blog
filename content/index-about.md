# Hello, beautiful world!
Welcome to my blog! I am Jan Domalaon - a mid 20s guy posting on the Internet. Here you will find things I find cool, (hopefully) insightful posts, and personal projects. Expect content about:
- Data science (mostly spatial/GIS)
- Video game development
- Music production
- Mathematics
- Lifestyle
- Faith

I hope you enjoy your time in my corner of the Internet ðŸ˜Ž

And I'm open to connect with y'all with any of my socials! I'm easiest to reach on my Discord @jan_bot.

## BTW, why the name, *homealone*?

Homealone rhymes with the anglicized pronunciation of my last name, *Domalaon*. Also, the user name *homealone* sounds edgy, is pretty versatile, and the movie Home Alone is peak cinema. I just hope I don't get copyrighted lol.
